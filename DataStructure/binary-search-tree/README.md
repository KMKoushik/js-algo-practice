# Binary search tree

## About
- Binary tree has nodes with two children
- Left's value will be less than the parent.
- Right's value is always higher than the parent.

## uses
- HTML dom
- File structure
- AST 

## methods

- insert()
- find()
- breathFirstSearch()
- depthFirstSearchPre()
- depthFirstSearchPost()

### note
BFS - will take lot of space if tree is wide
DFS - will take lot of space if tree is deep

DFS pre - flatten and reconstruct is easy. will help while storing and retrieving
DFS in - Data can be help to get data in sorted order
